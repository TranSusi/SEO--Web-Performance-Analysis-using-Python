# SEO--Web-Performance-Analysis-using-Python
1. What I done to achive: I get the overview of using Python to perform descriptive statistics to find out possible problems. Some visualisation and some analysis/ explaination are made.

2. What I have not yet done: The possible data-driven suggestion for the website optimization are not yet done. Visualisation are not showed and run in this platform using Matplotlib as planned. I did take screenshot of visualisations and attached to the notebook. The Statistics could need to be validated and more accuarate.

3. What I should do to improve:

a. Data-driven website optimization: Learn more knowledge about SEO for website marketing
b. Visualisation: Learn more about how to use Matplotlib in Jupyter Notebook/ Kaggle
c. Statistics: Learn more about descriptive statistic analysis including related visualisation
